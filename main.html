	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input or Time complexity, efficient</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> in computer science measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses, expressed as a function of the input size.O(n) (Linear Space): The memory usage grows proportionally to the input size. </p>
